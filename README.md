# Cloud-based Diabetes Prediction using Random Forest Classifier

This project leverages machine learning to predict whether an individual has diabetes based on features such as age, BMI, blood pressure, etc. The model is built using a Random Forest Classifier and deployed on AWS EC2 for cloud-based access.

## Features
- Predicts diabetes based on user input
- Trains a Random Forest Classifier on diabetes data
- Deployed on AWS EC2 for real-time predictions

## Technologies Used
- **Languages**: Python
- **Frameworks**: scikit-learn, Flask
- **Cloud**: AWS EC2
